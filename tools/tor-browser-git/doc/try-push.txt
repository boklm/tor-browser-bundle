tbgit try-push [OPTIONS]

Push topic branches to Mozilla Try server

  In the future this command will push topic branches to Mozilla Try,
  and use git-notes to store the results URL, but it is not implemented
  yet.

  Currently this command lists the branches that have not yet been
  pushed to Mozilla Try.

  The firefox and Tor Browser versions are determined from the currently
  checked out branch.

options:

 --yes          assume yes to all questions
 --list         don't submit anything, but list what branches should be submitted
 --max-push=<n> don't push more than n branches
